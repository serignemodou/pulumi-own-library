/**
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * *Create a service principal for an application*
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as azuread from "@pulumi/azuread";
 *
 * const current = azuread.getClientConfig({});
 * const example = new azuread.Application("example", {
 *     displayName: "example",
 *     owners: [current.then(current => current.objectId)],
 * });
 * const exampleServicePrincipal = new azuread.ServicePrincipal("example", {
 *     clientId: example.clientId,
 *     appRoleAssignmentRequired: false,
 *     owners: [current.then(current => current.objectId)],
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * *Create a service principal for an enterprise application*
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as azuread from "@pulumi/azuread";
 *
 * const current = azuread.getClientConfig({});
 * const example = new azuread.Application("example", {
 *     displayName: "example",
 *     owners: [current.then(current => current.objectId)],
 * });
 * const exampleServicePrincipal = new azuread.ServicePrincipal("example", {
 *     clientId: example.clientId,
 *     appRoleAssignmentRequired: false,
 *     owners: [current.then(current => current.objectId)],
 *     featureTags: [{
 *         enterprise: true,
 *         gallery: true,
 *     }],
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * *Manage a service principal for a first-party Microsoft application*
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as azuread from "@pulumi/azuread";
 *
 * const wellKnown = azuread.getApplicationPublishedAppIds({});
 * const msgraph = new azuread.ServicePrincipal("msgraph", {
 *     clientId: wellKnown.then(wellKnown => wellKnown.result?.microsoftGraph),
 *     useExisting: true,
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * *Create a service principal for an application created from a gallery template*
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as azuread from "@pulumi/azuread";
 *
 * const example = azuread.getApplicationTemplate({
 *     displayName: "Marketo",
 * });
 * const exampleApplication = new azuread.Application("example", {
 *     displayName: "example",
 *     templateId: example.then(example => example.templateId),
 * });
 * const exampleServicePrincipal = new azuread.ServicePrincipal("example", {
 *     clientId: exampleApplication.clientId,
 *     useExisting: true,
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * Service principals can be imported using their object ID, e.g.
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import azuread:index/servicePrincipal:ServicePrincipal example /servicePrincipals/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000
 * ```
